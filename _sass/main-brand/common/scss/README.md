# About the Common Design System Scss

There's a certain amount of styles that is necessary to set up a project in order to use the Design System that is outside of any particular component a lot of this is about shared brand. The components rely on these styles being present.

This is mainly:

- *Normalize* to even out cross-browser differences (similar but preferable to a reset)
- *Variables* to help each project reuse the same colour palette etc from a single source.
- *Helpers* mixins to help each project manage things like responsive web design, use the common grid system, and use the common typography hierarchy.
